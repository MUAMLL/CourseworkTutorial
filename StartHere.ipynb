    "## Course Summary\n",
    "This course leverages the foundations in statistics and programming to introduce concepts in machine learning (ML). Participants will learn various classes of machine learning and modeling techniques and gain an in-depth understanding of how to select appropriate techniques for various machine learning tasks. Topics cover a spectrum from simple modeling to more advanced algorithms such as support vector machines, decision trees/forests, and neural networks. \n"
